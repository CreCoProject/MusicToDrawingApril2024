# MusicToDrawingApril2024
This here is a Collection of Scripts
mainly for Processing which will translate
Ideas of Music to the Idea of Drawing and
Painting. The Idea is to show that there
are lot of Connections between Music and
Drawing. Even Kandinsky has shown that there
are a strong Connection is between Music 
and Drawing. The Pictures who shows what here
is posssible can been found at:
